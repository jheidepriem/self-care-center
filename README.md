# Self-Care Center

### Abstract:
[//]: <> (Briefly describe what you built and its features. What problem is the app solving? How does this application solve that problem?)
Built an application that will give the user a random mantra or affirmation of their choosing.

### Installation Instructions:
[//]: <> (What steps does a person have to take to get your app cloned down and running?) They just need to fork the project on Github https://github.com/jheidepriem/self-care-center, and clone it to their own machine in terminal and open in their text editor to make changes.

### Preview of App:
[//]: <> (Provide ONE gif or screenshot of your application - choose the "coolest" piece of functionality to show off.)

### Context:
[//]: <> (Give some context for the project here. How long did you have to work on it? How far into the Turing program are you?)
I'm halfway through Mod1. I spent a lot of time on this project trying to get the css to work properly. I started the project thursday evening and didnt finish until Sunday morning. Unfortunately, even after speaking with my mentors and rock, we could not get one of the headings in the appropriate place.

### Contributors:
[//]: <> (Who worked on this application? Link to their GitHubs.)
Just me - https://github.com/jheidepriem/self-care-center

### Learning Goals:
[//]: <> (What were the learning goals of this project? What tech did you work with?) The learning goals were to use HTML, CSS, and JS to match the comp. We also used eventListeners and I added an error alert.

### Wins + Challenges:
[//]: <> (What are 2-3 wins you have from this project? What were some challenges you faced - and how did you get over them?) Probably the biggest challenge I faced was the css. I feel like I have a much better understanding of HTML and CSS now.
