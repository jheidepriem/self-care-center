### Context:
- I'm halfway through Mod1. I spent a lot of time on this project trying to get the css to work properly. I started the project thursday evening and didnt finish until Sunday morning. Unfortunately, even after speaking with my mentors and rock, we could not get one of the headings in the appropriate place.
